                        <p class="fs-6">Engage treats any data that relates to an identified or identifiable individual, or that is linked or linkable to them by Engage, as “personal data”, regardless of where the individual is located geographically. This means that data that can directly identify - such as your name -  is personal data. Data that does not directly identify you, but that could identify you, such as any stored address, is also treated as personal data.</p>
                        <p class="fs-6">This Privacy Policy covers how Engage or an Engage-affiliated company handles personal data, whether you interact with us on our websites, through Engage apps or services, or in person (including by phone or video call). Engage may also link to third-parties on our services. Engage’s Privacy Policy does not apply to how third-parties define personal data or how they use it. We encourage you to read their privacy policies and know your privacy rights before making any interactions with them.</p>

                        <p class="fs-6">At Engage, we respect your ability to know, access, correct, transfer, restrict the processing of, and delete your personal data. We have provided these rights to our global user base and if you choose to exercise these privacy rights, you have the right not to be treated in a discriminatory way nor to receive a lesser degree of service from Engage. Engage does not sell your data, including as “sale” is defined in British Columbia, Canada.</p>
                        <p class="fs-6">To exercise your privacy rights and choices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@engageapp.net">support@engageapp.net</a>.</p>
                        <p class="fs-6">There may be situations where Engage will be unable to grant your request. For example, if you ask us to remove any data where Engage is legally obligated to maintain a record to comply with law. We may also decline to grant a request where doing so would undermine our legitimate use of your data for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you request the deletion of an account that is currently being investigated for fraud or security concerns. Other reasons your request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical for Engage to carry out.</p>
